# match
This game is a matching game where the user receives a word related to OOP.  They will have to match it to a certain definition or image given. In this game the main feature will include a reward system that allows the user to earn points per correct answer. If the user gets 3 in a row, they receive a star as a reward. If the user gets an answer incorrect, they lose their answer streak. This way they will not move on until they understand the basic concepts.  After a certain number of stars, the user can level up to more difficult OOP concepts.
